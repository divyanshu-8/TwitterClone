*   **Tweet Posting:** Users can create and post tweets with text and images.
*   **Following/Followers:** Users can follow other users to see their tweets in their home timeline.
*   **Likes:** Users can like tweets.
*   **Replies:** Users can reply to tweets, creating threaded conversations.
*   **Profile Management:** Users can update their profile information, including avatar, cover photo, bio, and username.
*   **Image Uploads:** Users can upload images to accompany their tweets and profile information.
**Supported Platforms/Requirements:**
*   Node.js (v16 or higher)
*   npm or yarn
*   MongoDB database
*   Google Cloud Console project with OAuth 2.0 Client ID and Secret
*   AWS S3 bucket for image storage
## Getting Started
### Installation
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```
    
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd twitter-clone
    ```
    
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```
    
### Configuration
1.  **Environment Variables:** Create a `.env.local` file in the project root and add the following environment variables:
   
    *   `MONGODB_URI`:  The connection string for your MongoDB database.
    *   `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`: Your Google OAuth 2.0 Client ID.  Obtain this from the Google Cloud Console.
    *   `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`: Your Google OAuth 2.0 Client Secret. Obtain this from the Google Cloud Console.
    *   `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`: A random string used to encrypt the NextAuth.js JWT.  Generate a secure random string.
    *   `NEXTAUTH_URL`: The URL of your application.  This is important for production deployments.
    *   `S3_ACCESS_KEY`: Your AWS S3 access key.
    *   `S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: Your AWS S3 secret access key.
2.  **Google OAuth Setup:**
    *   Go to the Google Cloud Console ([https://console.cloud.google.com/](https://console.cloud.google.com/)).
    *   Create a new project or select an existing one.
    *   Enable the Google People API.
    *   Create OAuth 2.0 credentials.
    *   Configure the Authorized JavaScript origins and Authorized redirect URIs.  For development, use `http://localhost:3000`.  For production, use your deployed URL.
3.  **AWS S3 Setup:**
    *   Create an AWS S3 bucket.
    *   Configure the bucket for public read access (for images).
    *   Create an IAM user with permissions to upload objects to the bucket.
    *   Obtain the access key and secret access key for the IAM user.
### Running the Application
1.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    ```
    
2.  **Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.**
**Key Components:**
*   **`components`:** Contains reusable React components for building the user interface.
*   **`hooks`:** Contains custom React hooks for managing state and logic.  `useUserInfo` is a key hook for fetching and providing user data.
*   **`lib`:** Contains utility functions for database connections (MongoDB and Mongoose).
*   **`models`:** Defines the Mongoose schemas for the database models (User, Post, Like, Follower).
*   **`pages`:** Contains the Next.js pages and API routes.  Dynamic routes (e.g., `[username].js`, `[id].js`) are used for user profiles and individual posts.
*   **`api`:** Contains the API routes that handle backend logic, such as authentication, data fetching, and data manipulation.
